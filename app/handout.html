      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of this seminar project is to become familiar with writing concurrent programs in c. The challenge
        is to manage resources that multiple clients can access simultanously in a way that neither blocks the client
        nor results in race conditions or deadlocks. However, any attempt to protect an individual resource should not
        block the system as a whole.
        
      </p>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        The Game has two main critical sections where race conditions or deadlocks can occur.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon Joining
        the game if the player count test and increment methods are not atomic, players might wait indefinitely
        even though there are enough to start.

      <p class="figtitle">Game cannot start because of deadlock</p>
      <p>
        If multiple players attempt to access the same cell simultaneously a potential race condition
        could occur.

      <p class="figtitle">Multiple players taking same cell</p>
      <h2>Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        The join process is made atomic using mutexes with condition variables. First a thread acquires the mutex
        lock, then waits on the condition until it updates. While waiting, other threads are able to acquire the lock.
        The incrementing and evaluating of the player count can be made atomic so that race conditions do not occur.
        While one thread is waiting other threads my enter the critical section, incrementing and evaluating, so no
        deadlocks occur.

      <blockquote class="dontsplit">
        <pre>pthread_cond_t ready = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;
pthread_mutex_t lock = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
int join_game()
{
    pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);
    if (--join_countdown > 0)
        pthread_cond_wait(&ready, &lock);
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&join_lock);
    pthread_cond_signal(&ready);
    return 1;
}
</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The take process is simpler. It needs no condition variable, but it uses the pthread_mutex_trylock method to
        test the lock status before attempting to acquire it. In this way clients are notified that they are not able
        to currently take the cell.
        
      </p>

        <pre>int request_cell_lock(int x, int y)
{
  if (get_cell(x, y) == NULL) {
    return -1;
  }
  return pthread_mutex_trylock(
    &get_cell(x, y)->lock
  );
}
</pre>

      <h2>Methods and Tools</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Separation of Concerns : the server has two components, the TCP Handler and the Field Manager. Each can be
          independently tested.
        </li>
        <li>Communication between the components implemented using function pointers.</li>
        <li>Testing through the use of "mock-ed" function pointers</li>
        <li>Automated and configurable test clients implemented in C++ using the JUCE Framework</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Invest in Testing from the very beginning. It's worth it.</li>
        <li>Begin documentation early.</li>
        <li>
          JUCE is good cross platform C++ framework. Not just a good audio engine as it is
          described on the website ( http://www.juce.com )
