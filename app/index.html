      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of this seminar project is to become familiar with writing concurrent programs in c. The main
        challenge is to manage shared resources that multiple clients can access simultaneously. During the period
        when one client is using a specific resource it must be guaranteed that another client cannot manipulate the
        resource. However, any attempt to protect an individual resource should not block the system as a whole.
        
      </p>
      <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>There should be no global lock</li>
        <li>The server will save the names of the players</li>
        <li>Communication via TCP/IP</li>
        <li>Concurrency can be implemented through forking and shared memory
          <ul>
            <li>or optionally with threads</li>
            <li>one thread or process per client connection</li>
            <li>the main thread can bind/listen/accept</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The focus is on the Server Implementation
          <ul>
            <li>The Client is primarily for testing and "having fun"</li>
            <li>The Server will be tested by a Script from the Lecturer</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Locking, and simultaneous access is implemented by the Server</li>
        <li>Debugging messages from the Client/Server to stderr</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>
        The assigned task is to program a multi-player game. When at least two players have connected to the game server
        the game will begin. More players can join or leave the game at any time. Players compete to obtain cells in the
        games n x n grid, where n is equal to the number of players. The goal is for a player to obtain all the cell in
        the playing field.
        
      </p>
      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
      <ul>
        <li class="dontsplit">The Server starts and waits until more than 2 players have joined the game.</li>
        <li class="dontsplit">As soon as 2 players have joined, the players may begin trying to obtain the field.</li>
        <li class="dontsplit">New players may join or leave the game at any time</li>
        <li class="dontsplit">The Server tests the status of the game field every y seconds, where 1 <= y <= 30
          <ul>
            <li class="dontsplit">
              If a player, at the time the status is checked, has obtained all the cells of a field, that player
              has won the game and the game is ended.
              
              
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Communication Protokol</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Every command is ended with \n</li>
        <li class="dontsplit">No command is longer than 256 characters, including \n</li>
        <li class="dontsplit">Every player can only send 1 command and must wait for the response</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Successful Registration</h3>
      <blockquote class="dontsplit">
        <p>Client: HELLO\n</p>
        <p>Server: SIZE n\n</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Unsuccessful registration:</h3>
      <blockquote class="dontsplit">
        <p>Client: HELLO\n</p>
        <p>Server: NACK\n</p>
        <p>-> Terminate Connection</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Game Start</h3>
      <blockquote class="dontsplit">
        <p>Server: START\n</p>
        <p>Client: - (no response expected)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Obtain cell successful</h3>A cell can be taken when no other player is currently in the process of take the same cell.
      <blockquote class="dontsplit">
        <p>Client: TAKE X Y\n</p>
        <p>Server: TAKEN\n</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Obtain cell unsuccessful</h3>If one of more other players are currently in the process of taking the same cell, all attempts
      except the first one will be unsuccessful
      <blockquote class="dontsplit">
        <p>Client: TAKE X Y\n</p>
        <p>Server: INUSE\n</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Show Cell Status</h3>
      <blockquote class="dontsplit">
        <p>Client: STATUS X Y\n</p>
        <p>Server: Name-of-Player\n</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>End of Game</h3>As soon as a player has obtained all the cells of the playing field he or she has won the game
      The server will respond to any other client's command by sending the win message.
      <blockquote class="dontsplit">
        <p>Server: END Name-of-Player\n</p>
        <p>Client: - ( client ends game )</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Server Installation</h2>
      <p>
        Typing </strong class="mono">> make</strong> in the root directory of the project will start the makefile build
        process. The server and client console applications will be compiled and built in their respective folders
        
      </p>
      <p class="mono">
        sem_concurrent_c/server/Builds/Linux/build/server
        sem_concurrent_c/client/Builds/LinuxMakefile/build/client
        
      </p>
      <p>
        To run the server start the server in the console. Type any character followed by enter to end the server. The
        default parameters that the server uses when starting are port = 65002 and size = 4. When starting the server
        you can pass these parameters as arguments to the server.
        
      </p>
      <blockquote class="dontsplit">
        <p>./server 65123 16</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This will start the server listening on port 65123 and a playing field of 16 x 16 cells.</p>
      <p>
        The default settings of the client and servers are matched so they will automatically connect if run from the same
        computer.
        
      </p>
      <h2>Test Installation</h2>
      <p>
        There are 3 test applications, one for testing TCP Handling, one for testing the game resources, and one that
        tests both parts together. In order to run the test applications you must download the JUCE C++ framework. The
        project build settings expect to find the JUCE library files locationed in the same directory where the
        project is located. If you have downloaded the project to you Documents folder, the JUCE directory should also
        be located in your Documents folder.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        The test applications can be build by running make from within their respective /Builds/Linux/ subdirectories.
        
      </p>
      <h2>Project Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        The server application is implemented in 2 parts, a <strong>Field Manager</strong> and a <strong>TCP Server</strong>.
        The Field Manager manages handling and access to the field resources. The necessary locks to prevent race conditions
        are implemented in the field manager. The TCP Server manages the connections to the clients, starts threads for
        each client. The TCP Server's thread handler function passes commands to the Field Manager via a set of function
        pointers which are registered before the TCP Server starts.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        The decision to split the program into two components was made in oder to makes testing of each component easier.
        Each component can be tested independently of the other component. The Field Manager can be tested without the
        extra complexity of the socket handling. The TCP Server can be tested without the extra complexity of the lock
        and mutex handling.
      </p>
      <p>
        The use of function pointers as the connection between the Field Manager and the TCP Server makes testing easier
        as well because other functions can be registered that have a predefined behavior that "mocks" the function of
        the other component in a controlled manner.
        
      </p>
      <h3>Field Manager</h3>
      <p>
        The requirements of the game state that the game field is n*n in size, and for the game to start a minimum of
        n/2 players must join the game. That means that a minimum of 4 players must join a game that is 8 x 8 in size.
        The requirements also state that players can join or leave the game at any time. The Field Manager module is
        responsible for managing the "game logic".
        
      </p>
      <h4>Field Manager Lifecycle</h4>
      <ul>
        <li class="dontsplit">
          Field Manager is initialized with the desired field dimension. All variables are set to their initial

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Field Initializsation</h4>
      <p>
        When the Field Manager is initialized, the size parameter is used to determine the size of the field and the
        minimum number of players required to start the game. The field is n x n, and the minimum number of players is
        n/2, where n is the given size.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        The field itself is initialized as a <span class="mono dontsplit">struct field</span>, with a pointer an array of
        nxn <span class="mono dontsplit">struct cell</span> elements. Each <span class="mono dontsplit">struct cell</span>
        holds a variable <span class="mono dontsplit">int player_id</span> which stores the id of the current owner as
        well an a mutex which prevents the cell from being manipulated by two threads at the same time.

      <p class="figtitle">Initialize Cells</p>
      <h4>Clients can join a game</h4>
      <p>
        The game is initialized with size n. The playing field is created as an nxn "grid" of cells. Then players can
        register to join the game. The game will not start until n/2 players have joined, at which point the server will
        send the "START\n" message to all players that are waiting to join the game.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        Each client is managed in the server by a specific thread. The client threads ( Implemented in the TCP
        Manager ) can register for a game concurrently. The mechanism that counts the number of registered clients and
        allows the game to begin is a critical section that must be managed carefully in order to not have race conditions
        or deadlocks.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally I tried to implement the joining mechanism using pthread_barrier_wait. The idea was that the
        pthread_barrier_t mutex would be initialized with count n/2. Every attempt to join decrements the count until
        it reaches 0. At that moment all waiting threads are able to proceed. The problem is that the pthread_barrier_t
        resets to the initial count value after reaching 0. New players attempting to join the game would have to wait until
        an additional n/2 new players attempt to join. Also pthread_barrier_t is not available natively on OSX.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead the joining process is managed with a conditional mutex.
        
        
      </p>
      <blockquote class="dontsplit">
        <pre>pthread_cond_t join_ready = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;
pthread_mutex_t join_lock = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

int join_game()
{
    pthread_mutex_lock(&join_lock);
    if (--join_countdown > 0)
    {
        pthread_cond_wait(&join_ready, &join_lock);
    }
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&join_lock);
    pthread_cond_signal(&join_ready);
    return 0;
}</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="figtitle">Join Game Function</p>
      <p>
        The mutex_lock make the if-test, decrement, and cond_wait an atomic process. Only one single thread can be active
        after the first lock, until it reaches and waits at the pthread_cond_wait() function, or until it reaches the
        pthread_mutex_unlock() function. After the unlock it will signal any other threads waiting at pthread_cond_wait()
        that they may resume.
        
      </p>
      <h4>Requesting to "Take" a cell</h4>
      <p>
        By calling take_cell(int x, int y, int player_id) a player makes a request to take a cell. The field_manager
        converts the xy-coordinated to the respective array index. With the index it retreives the cell and tests
        the cell's mutex to see if it is currently in use by another thread. If it's free then the mutex is attained,
        the cell's player_id variable is set to the thread's client's id, then the mutex is released. If the cell's mutex
        is held by another cell then the function returns EBUSY.

      <h4>Checking for a Winner</h4>
      <p>
        The Field Manager has a function which can be called by a "referee" thread that will test if there is currently
        a winner. This is the only function that will temporarily block all activity on a global level. While the "referee"
        is checking all the cells, no other threads can take a cell. In addition, the "referee" must wait for all pending
        take requests to finish before it can block all cells. This is implemented using a pthread_rwlock_t in the field
        struct.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        When player threads request the read permissions of the field's pthread_rwlock_t variable. Only if the "referee"
        is currently holding the write key of the pthread_rwlock_t will the take request be blocked.

      <h3>TCP Server</h3>
      <p>
        The TCP Server manages the communication with the client. It is multi-threaded, with one thread per client,
        one referee thread, and one main server thread. It interacts with the Field Manager via function pointers which
        are registered at startup.

      <h4> Registering Field Manager Function Pointers</h4>
      <p>
        All communication between the TCP Server and the Field Manager is handled through function pointers. The
        TCP Server calls functions on the Field Manager, the return values indicate whether the method succeeded.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        The decision to use function pointers was made in order to make it possible to easily swap out the Field
        Manager's functions with other mocked functions for testing. Without this possibility it would be more
        difficult to do real multi-threaded testing. By swapping the real functions with mock functions it is
        possible to test the TCP Manager in completely entcoupled form the Field Manager.

      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p>
        While developing the modules, tests were developed at the same time in a pseudo test driven development
        method. Pseudo, because the tests were not strictly written first and not every function was explicitly
        tested. Instead, threadable client objects were created which could be given a playbook of instructions.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        The clients are started simultaneously, at which point they begin to follow their instructions as defined
        in the playbook.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        The test applications are console based applications programmed using the JUCE C++ library.n The JUCE
        library includes a simple Unit Testing framework. A unit test is made by creating an object that inherits
        from UnitTest and overriding the <span class="mono">void runTest();</span> method.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        The TCPServerTests object has 3 tests that are called from the <span class="mono">void runTest();</span> method.
        
      </p>
      <blockquote class="dontsplit">
        <pre>void TCPServerTests::runTest()
{
    FirstTest();
    ServerTest();
    Thread::sleep(5);
    ConnectionTest();

        The sleep directives are adding so that the TCP Server has time to shutdown all it's threads properly and
        close it's sockets before the next test begins.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        The FirstTest() function simply tests that the testing environment is running properly and does not even
        start the TCP Server. The other tests will always register callbacks with the TCP Server, start the server, do
        some tests, then shutdown the server.

      <p class="figtitle">TCPServerTests ConnectionTest()</p>
      <p>
        This ConnectTest() method begins by registering a set of mock functions that simulate behavior of the Field
        Manager. These can be swapped out quickly with other functions to test different outcomes. <span class="mono">
        always_allow_take</span> for instance can be replaced with <span class="mono">every_second_take</span>. The
        corresponding TCP Server responses to the client are written to the stderr console.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        The server is started on port 65002 before the client is configured. Simple instructions like join or sleep
        can be passed to the client in one line. Instructions that require more parameters like take and status can
        be passed to the instruction object which has already been registered with the client. In the test above, the
        client is given the instruction to sleep for 2 seconds, the join the game, then sleep again for 2 seconds.
        The next instruction given to the client is to request a cell using the take command. It will attept to take
        the cell with coordinates x:0, y:1, with the name "Frank".
        
      </p>
      <p>
        When all the instructions are passed to a client object, the client itself is handed over to a thread pool
        manager. The main test thread periodically checks the thread pool to see if jobs are still running. When all
        the jobs are finished the server is instructed to shutdown. The test function completes when the server_running()
        function returns 0. After this is still might take a moment for the operating system to completely close all
        sockets.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        The Field Manager tests are also run using client objects using instructions, managed by thread pools. They
        do not require any socket handling, but it must be possible to test the mutex blocking properly. The Field
        Manager has the option to add an artificial delay to all it's methods. By giving two client objects the same
        take instructions and setting the delay to over a second, it's possible carefully test the behavior or the
        Field Manager when take requests compete for the same resources.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        The project also includes a consolidated_tests suite which tests the behavior of the TCP Manager and the
        Field Manager together. It includes the following tests:

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        This is a project with a lot of moving pieces; sockets, threads, mutexes, memory management. In order to really
        learn how the pieces fit together it's important to be able to understand the real behavior and quirks of all the
        pieces. By splitting responsibilities into separate modules and simultaneously developing the tests for them
        was very helpful. The testing part of the code grew to be as large as the actual implementation, but during
        development it also became playground to quickly try out different ideas. By having tests in place and knowing
        that previous portions of code are working properly, one can have more confidence trying out other ideas, without
        the fear breaking things.

        I originally wanted to try the testing framework cmocka (https://cmocka.org/) but it required using CMAKE and
        I lost too much time just trying to figure out how to integrate cmocka into a project.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided to use the JUCE library unit testing features. I already had some experience using JUCE and knew it included
        several tools that make integrating it into a project very easy. Although the unit testing features of JUCE are
        very simple, JUCE comes with many other features that made building the test environment easy and fun. Especially
        the Thread Pool tools and the NamedValueSet made it easy to quickly put together very advanced automated client
        objects.
