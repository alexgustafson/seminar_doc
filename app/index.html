      <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of this seminar project is to become familiar with writing concurrent programs in c. The main
        challenge is to manage shared resources that multiple clients can access simultaneously. During the period
        when one client is using a specific resource it must be guaranteed that another client cannot manipulate the
        resource. However, any attempt to protect an individual resource should not block the system as a whole.
        
      </p>
      <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>There should be no global lock</li>
        <li>The server will save the names of the players</li>
        <li>Communication via TCP/IP</li>
        <li>Concurrency can be implemented through forking and shared memory
          <ul>
            <li>or optionally with threads</li>
            <li>one thread or process per client connection</li>
            <li>the main thread can bild/listen/accpet</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The focus is on the Server Implementation
          <ul>
            <li>The Client is primarily for testing and "having fun"</li>
            <li>The Server will be tested by a Script from the Lecturer</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Locking, and simultaneous access is implemented by the Server</li>
        <li>Debugging messages from the Client/Server to stderr</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>
        The assigned task is to program a multiplayer game. When at least two players have connected to the game server
        the game will begin. More players can join or leave the game at any time. Players compete to obtain cells in the
        games n x n grid, where n is equal to the number of players. The goal is for a player to obtain all the cell in
        the playing field.
        
      </p>
      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The Server starts and waits until more than 2 players have joined the game.</li>
        <li>As soon as 2 players have joined, the players may begin trying to obtain the field.</li>
        <li>New players may join or leave the game at any time</li>
        <li>The Server tests the status of the game field every y seconds, where 1 <= y <= 30
          <ul>
            <li>
              If a player, at the time the status is checked, has obtained all the cells of a field, that player
              has won the game and the game is ended.
              
              
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Communication Protokol</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Every command is ended with \n</li>
        <li>No command is longer than 256 characters, including \n</li>
        <li>Every player can only send 1 command and must wait for the response</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Successful Registration</h3>
      <blockquote class="dontsplit">
        <p>Client: HELLO\n</p>
        <p>Server: SIZE n\n</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Unsuccessful registration:</h3>
      <blockquote class="dontsplit">
        <p>Client: HELLO\n</p>
        <p>Server: NACK\n</p>
        <p>-> Terminate Connection</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Game Start</h3>
      <blockquote class="dontsplit">
        <p>Server: START\n</p>
        <p>Client: - (no response expected)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Obtain cell successful</h3>A cell can be taken when no other player is currently in the process of take the same cell.
      <blockquote class="dontsplit">
        <p>Client: TAKE X Y\n</p>
        <p>Server: TAKEN\n</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Obtain cell unsuccessful</h3>If one of more other players are currently in the process of taking the same cell, all attempts
      except the first one will be unsuccessful
      <blockquote class="dontsplit">
        <p>Client: TAKE X Y\n</p>
        <p>Server: INUSE\n</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Show Cell Status</h3>
      <blockquote class="dontsplit">
        <p>Client: STATUS X Y\n</p>
        <p>Server: Name-of-Player\n</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>End of Game</h3>As soon as a player has obtained all the cells of the playing field he or she has won the game
      The server will respond to any other client's command by sending the win message.
      <blockquote class="dontsplit">
        <p>Server: END Name-of-Player\n</p>
        <p>Client: - ( client ends game )</p>

      <h2>Project Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        The server application is implemented in 2 parts, a <strong>Field Manager</strong> and a <strong>TCP Server</strong>.
        The Field Manager manages handling and access to the field resources
